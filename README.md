# Practicing Python: Lists and Tuples

This repository contains study notes, practical exercises, and code implementations derived from the "Practicing Python: Lists and Tuples" course. It focuses on the manipulation of fundamental data structures in Python, specifically targeting backend development scenarios.

## 1. Project Overview

The primary goal of this repository is to document the learning process regarding Python collections. It covers the essential differences between mutable (lists) and immutable (tuples) sequences, their appropriate use cases in software engineering, and performance considerations.

This coursework is part of the **Python Back-End Development** career track, emphasizing clean code and efficient data handling.

## 2. Key Concepts Covered

* **Lists:** Creation, manipulation, and dynamic sizing of mutable arrays.
* **Tuples:** Utilization of immutable sequences for data integrity.
* **Polymorphism:** Handling different collection types within the same pipeline.
* **Iteration & Enumeration:** Efficient traversal of data structures using built-in Python methods.
* **List Comprehensions:** Writing concise and readable code for data transformation.

## 3. Technology Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Environment:** IDLE / VS Code / Jupyter Notebook (depending on implementation)
